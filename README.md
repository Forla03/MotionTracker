# Motion Tracker

This Android application collects and logs sensor data from the device's **Accelerometer**, *
*Gyroscope**, and **Magnetometer** and from a Movesense sensor in real-time. The app can be used for
applications such as motion analysis, sensor fusion, or any use case where precise sensor data is
needed.

## Features

✅ Real-time data acquisition from the following smartphone sensors:
- Accelerometer (measures acceleration forces)
- Gyroscope (measures device rotation)
- Magnetometer (measures magnetic field strength)

⏳ Real-time acquisition of sensor data from Moveseense sensor:
- Accelerometer (measures acceleration forces)
- Gyroscope (measures device rotation)
- Magnetometer (measures magnetic field strength)

✅ Data Logging: Save sensor data in CSV format for post-processing.

✅ Simple user interface to start, stop, and export sensor data.

✅ Store data on Firebase Storage Database for remote access.

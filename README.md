This Android application collects and logs sensor data from the device's **Accelerometer**, **Gyroscope**, and **Magnetometer** in real-time. The app can be used for applications such as motion analysis, sensor fusion, or any use case where precise sensor data is needed.

## Features

- Real-time data acquisition from:
    - Accelerometer (measures acceleration forces)
    - Gyroscope (measures device rotation)
    - Magnetometer (measures magnetic field strength)

- Data Logging: Save sensor data in CSV format for post-processing.
- Simple user interface to start, stop, and export sensor data.
- Store data on Firebase Realtime Database for remote access.
